Docker Enterprise is designed for enterprise
development and IT teams who build, ship, and run business-critical
applications in production and at scale. Docker Enterprise is integrated, certified,
and supported to provide enterprises with the most secure container platform
in the industry. For more info about Docker Enterprise, including purchasing
options, see [Docker Enterprise](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-enterprise).

There are currently two versions of Docker Engine - Enterprise available:

* 18.03 - Use this version if you're only running Docker Engine - Enterprise, and not the full Docker Enterprise platform.
* 17.06 - Use this version if you're using Docker Enterprise 2.0 (Docker Engine - Enterprise, UCP, and DTR).

## Docker Enterprise tiers

{% include docker_ce_ee.md %}

### Docker Engine - Enterprise

With Docker Engine - Enterprise, you can manage your container workloads in a flexible way. You can manage workloads
on Windows or Linux; on-premises or on the cloud. Docker Engine - Enteprise also includes Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 encryption modules.

Docker Engine - Enterprise has enterprise class support with defined SLAs, extended
maintenance cycles for patches for up to 24 months.

[Learn more about the supported platforms](#supported-platforms).

### Docker Enterprise Standard and Advanced

Docker Enterprise Standard includes Docker Engine - Enterprise and extends it with
private image management, integrated image signing policies, and cluster
management with support for Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators.

Docker Enteprise Advanced takes this one step further and allows you to implement
node-based RBAC policies, image promotion policies, image mirroring, and
scan your images for vulnerabilities.

## Supported platforms

The following table shows all of the platforms that are available for Docker Enterprise.
Each link in the first column takes you to the installation
instructions for the corresponding platform. Docker Enterprise is an integrated,
supported, and certified container platform for the listed cloud providers and
operating systems.


### On-premises

These are the operating systems where you can install Docker Enterprise.

### Docker Certified Infrastructure

Docker Certified Infrastructure is Dockerâ€™s prescriptive approach to deploying
Docker Enterprise on a range of infrastructure choices. Each Docker
Certified Infrastructure includes a reference architecture
and third-party ecosystem solution briefs.

| Platform                                                                                | Docker Enterprise Edition |

## Docker Enterprise release cycles

Each Docker Enterprise release is supported and maintained for 24 months, and
receives security and critical bug fixes during this period.

The Docker API version is independent of the Docker platform version. We maintain
careful API backward compatibility and deprecate APIs and features slowly and
conservatively. We remove features after deprecating them for a period of
three stable releases. Docker 1.13 introduced improved interoperability
between clients and servers using different API versions, including dynamic
feature negotiation.

## Upgrades and support

If you're a Docker DDC or CS Engine customer, you don't need to upgrade to
Docker Enterprise to continue to get support. We will continue to support customers
with valid subscriptions whether the subscription covers Docker Enterprise or
Commercially Supported Docker. You can choose to stay with your current
deployed version, or you can upgrade to the latest Docker Enterprise version. For
more info, see [Scope of Coverage and Maintenance
Lifecycle](https://success.docker.com/Policies/Scope_of_Support).
